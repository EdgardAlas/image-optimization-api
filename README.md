This API provides a simple way to optimize images by resizing and compressing them. It supports various image formats and allows you to specify the desired width, height, and quality of the output image.

## Features

- Resize images to specified dimensions

- Support for multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, ETC)
- Easy to use with a simple RESTful interface
- Return images in base64 format
- Support 20 images per request, up to 10MB each

## TODO

- [ ] Implement image rotation feature
- [ ] Improve performance for large images
- [ ] Add unit tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Add caching for optimized images
- [ ] Implement authentication for API access
